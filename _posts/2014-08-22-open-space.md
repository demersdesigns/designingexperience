For the past 10 years or so, I have had the typical office environment. You know the one with a desk, a small set of drawers, and a place to make your own with whatever tchotchkes you choose to place about. Another positive with a dedicated space is the ability to add an external monitor, a keyboard, and mouse. After having this setup both at home and at a handful of offices over the years, I certainly couldn't imagine being able to be productive in any other scenario.

So, today, I started a new job, and the office has embraced the [\"hot desking\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_desking) system. If you aren't familiar with this system, it basically allows office workers to sit wherever they are going to be most productive. The idea is that by offering a number of different seating options, you are providing a number of different opportunities for workers to be the most productive depending on the tasks they need to complete. If you need some time to deep dive into some code or design, you can opt for a more private and quiet space. If you are trying to flush out a design problem with a few others, you could huddle around a table and work collaboratively.

Knowing that this was the setup for my new office, I took a full week to transition and prepare. I was very skeptical at my ability to be productive without a larger external monitor that allows me to essentially have a dual monitor setup by using the laptop screen as a second screen. I also was not really sure how it would be to come in every day and not have a dedicated space. Would I miss having pieces of flair to personalize my space? Would it be weird to not have a drawer of two to throw random stuff that I needed to keep close by?

As it turns out, the transition to using only the laptop without the external monitor was pretty smooth. After some creative window placement, I feel like I am just as productive as I was with the larger sceen real estate. Now, I haven't done a whole lot of real serious design tasks yet, but, I assume with some planning, it will be manageable. While the laptop keyboard is perfectly usable, I think I will have to at least use the external mouse as the trackpad really makes things difficult.

During my transition time, I did still have a dedicated desk space, so today was my first real day as a drifter. It is still too early to give a fair assessment, but it was pretty nice to stand for a few hours, then transition to sitting for another few hours. I think it will be really great to be able to float around the office especially since I am the new guy and don't really know a whole lot of people. More to come.
